# SalesmanManagementSystem

A web application that is aesthetically consistent with the colors of the brand and allows the client to track the progress of each salesman set targets for them, maintain records of their sales, approve orders placed by the retailer, track their status in terms of shipment and payment and view complaints from the people in the company. Furthermore, it should allow salesmen to update the status of orders to update their progress and allow retailers to view their past orders while giving them the facility to place new orders on the software itself.
